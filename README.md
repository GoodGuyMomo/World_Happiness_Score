The Overarching Question:
How do the variations in socioeconomic status influence the perception of trust and happiness throughout different countries?

Questions that will help us answer the overarching question:
1. Does the average GDP per capita have a direct relationship with the perceived happiness (life ladder) of each country's population?
2. Is there an overall significant cause/effect relationship between social support and generosity?
3. When comparing the two countries with the highest and lowest GDP per capita, does freedom to make life choices influence the confidence placed in each country's national government?
4. Is there a need for a higher GDP per capita in order to expect a higher health life expectancy at birth?
5. On a global scale, are people becoming more happy or sad over the years?
